# Frontend Mentor - Designo agency website solution

## Developed with

- Built with:
  - [Astro]([https://reactjs.org/](https://astro.build/)) - Web framework
  - [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For improved HTML
- [Resend](https://resend.com/) - for sending email 

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Click the "About Me" call-to-action on the homepage and have the screen scroll down to the next section
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The Name, Email Address or Message fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The Email Address is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


## Implementation
The application uses standard html and css along with astro islands to enchance development of the ui. HTMX helped to reduce
the amount of JavaScript that would had to be used otherwise for some transitions and http requests, such as the contact form.


## Future Development

Potential future developments for the application include:

- Possibly added pages for various content
- More interactivity on pages such as the project page
